Teradata AppCenter (AppCenter) is self-service execution platform for creating and running custom SQL, BTEQ, or Java applications (apps). These apps query data from Teradata, Aster, or Presto systems and return a result set that can include custom visualizations. AppCenter includes privacy settings for both the apps and results. You can run apps on demand or set up a schedule to run them automatically. 

AppCenter is deployed as part of the the Teradata Managed Cloud, with future releases that will support public clouds, such as Amazon and Azure, and on-premises. It provides a feature-rich UI and complete API support.
