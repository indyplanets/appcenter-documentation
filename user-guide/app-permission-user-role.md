The combination of an app's permission settings, the roles of users logged in, and job results privacy settings, determines who can see the app, run the app, view app results, and edit and delete the app. 

## App Permissions

**App Permissions** are available at the bottom of the **Create/Edit App** view.

| Permission  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Managers**  | When you create an app, AppCenter adds you as a Manager by default. App Managers can can view app settings and app results, edit and delete apps, and add or remove Managers.|
| **Privacy**  | When you create an app, the **Privacy On** option is selected by default, which means only Managers, Admins, or designated Private Users can see the app. Managers and Admins can turn privacy off to make the app public, which means everyone can see the app. |
| **Private users**  | Private users for the app can view the app, run the app, and view the app's job results. <br> **Note**: If you are a Private user for an app that has restricted results, you must also be added as a user to those results.|

## User Roles

User types include the following:

| User  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **User** | <ul><li>View, run, see results for, edit, and delete apps they manage.</li><li>item2</li></ul>|
| **Privacy**  | When you create an app, it is private by default. Managers and Admins can see private apps, turn privacy off, and  add or remove other private users. Added private users who are not managers or Admins, can view the app, run the app, and review app results.

There are three primary user types:

* User
* Admin
* System Administrator

## User

As a user, you can do the following:
* View, run, and see results for public apps.
* Create public or private apps.
* View, run, edit, and delete apps you create. 
* View logs associated with apps you create. 
* Add other users as **Private users** to private apps you create.
* Add other users as **Managers** to the private or public apps you create, which enables them to run, edit, and delete the app.
* View private apps created by other users who added you as a **Private user**.
* View, run, edit, and delete apps created by other users who added you to **Managers**.
