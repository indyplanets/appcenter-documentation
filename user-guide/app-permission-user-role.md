The combination of an app's permission settings and role of users logged in determines who can see the app, run the app, view results, and edit and delete the app.

## App Permissions

| Permission  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Managers**  | The user who creates an app is the app's first manager. A manager or Admin can view, edit, and delete apps, and can add or remove other managers.|
| **Privacy**  | When you create an app, the **Privacy On** option is selected by default; this means only managers, Admins, or designated private users can see the app. Managers and Admins can turn privacy off to make the app public, which means the app can be and  add or remove other private users. Added private users who are not managers or Admins, can view the app, run the app, and review app results.

## User Types

User types include the following:

| User  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **User** (non-admin and non-manager) | View, run, and see results for public apps.|
| **Privacy**  | When you create an app, it is private by default. Managers and Admins can see private apps, turn privacy off, and  add or remove other private users. Added private users who are not managers or Admins, can view the app, run the app, and review app results.

There are three primary user types:

* User
* Admin
