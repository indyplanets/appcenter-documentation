# Login

AppCenter is backed by authentication using an organization's existing LDAP server. Typically this means you can use the same credentials you use to log into any other service provided by your organization.

## Login Screen

The login screen will appear and prompt for your username and password. Typically this is your standard LDAP account credentials. Once you have placed your credentials, click the login button to sign in. If you fail to login, you'll be requested to try again. 

Once you have logged in, your session will be valid for 2 hours before you will be prompted to log in again.  

> If your login credentials fail, you will need to talk to your AppCenter system administrator to determine if you have access, or if there is an alternative login configuration setup.
