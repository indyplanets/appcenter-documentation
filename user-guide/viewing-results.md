AppCenter maintains a list of app runs. For each app run, there are multiple result records. User role, app permissions, and job results permissions determine who can see the list of app runs and who can access result records. 

## Viewing App Results

When an app run is completed, AppCenter automatically displays the results. You can view the app results at that time, or any time later.

1. Do one of the following:
  * If the app just finished running and you want to view the results immediately, click the ```Run #...``` line above the ![run successful checkmark](images/run-checkmark.png) at the top of the list. 
  * If you want to view results from a previous app run, click the app in the Dashboard or **Manage Apps**, and then click the ```Run #...``` line above the ![run successful checkmark](images/run-checkmark.png) for the run want.
2. Click any *View result data set...** link to view that particular result record. 
3. If the result contains visualizations, hover the mouse over or click components for more information.
3. [Optional] Click **Logs** to view app run logs. The ```Run #" in the **Recent Activity** list is associated with the ```job id``` in the log records.  
  
**Note:** If the app run failed, there are no app run result details. AppCenter provides error information in the logs.
