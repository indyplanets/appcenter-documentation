For each app run, AppCenter creates results records and logs. The user role, app permissions, and job results permissions determine who can see the list of app runs and logs and who can access result records. 

## Viewing App Results

1. Do one of the following:
  * If the app just finished running, click the `Run #...` line at the top of the list. 
  * Click the app in the Dashboard or **Manage Apps**, and then click the `Run #...` line for the app run you want.
2. For successful app runs, click the *View result data set...** link to view result records. 

  **Note:** If the app run failed, there are no app run result details. AppCenter provides error information in the logs. See [Viewing App Results Logs](#viewing-app-results-logs)

3. If the result contains a visualization, hover the mouse over or click any component for more information.

## Viewing App Results Logs

1. Do one of the following:
  * If the app just finished running, click **Logs**, and then click the log record at the top of the list. 
  * Click the app in the Dashboard or **Manage Apps**, click **Logs**, and then click the log record of interest.
 
   **Tip:** The `job id...` in the log record is the `Run #...` number in the **Recent Activity** list.  

### Searching for Log Results
