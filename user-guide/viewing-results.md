For each app run, AppCenter creates results records. The user role, app permissions, and job results permissions determine who can see the list of app runs and who can access result records. 

## Viewing App Results

1. Do one of the following:
  * If the app just finished running and you want to view the results immediately, click the ```Run #...``` line above the ![run successful checkmark](images/run-checkmark.png) at the top of the list. 
  * If you want to view results from a previous app run, click the app in the Dashboard or **Manage Apps**, and then click the `Run #...` line above the ![run successful checkmark](images/run-checkmark.png) for the run want.
2. For successful app runs, click the *View result data set...** link to view result records. 

  **Note:** If the app run failed, there are no app run result details. AppCenter provides error information in the logs.

3. If the result contains a visualization, hover the mouse over or click any component for more information.
4. [Optional] Click **Logs** to view app run logs. 

  **Note:** The ```job id``` in the log record is the ```Run #" number in the **Recent Activity** list.
