User type and role determines which AppCenter features you have access to, which apps you can see and run, and which apps you can manage (edit and delete). 

There are three user types:

* User
* Admin
* System Administrator

## User

As a user, you can do the following:
* View, run, and see results for public apps.
* Create public or private apps.
* View, run, edit, and delete apps you create. 
* View logs associated with apps you create. 
* Add other users as **Private users** to private apps you create.
* Add other users as **Managers** to the private or public apps you create, which enables them to run, edit, and delete the app.
* View private apps created by other users who added you as a **Private user**.
* View, run, edit, and delete apps created by other users who added you to **Managers**.
