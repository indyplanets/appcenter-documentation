# Create an App

When you create a new app, you are creating a wrapper around some core logic that can be executed and reused by AppCenter.

To begin creating your own app, you will need to first decide the type of app to create.

## App Types

Depending on the type of app you create, you can do different things. There are three types of apps that you can create with AppCenter. Let's take a look at the different types of apps and why you might use one or the other.

### SQL Apps

SQL apps are great for taking existing workloads that can be expressed entirely as SQL and bringing them into AppCenter. SQL apps accept a single SQL file containing the various statements to be run against the database.

### BTEQ Apps

Similar to SQL, BTEQ \(Basic Teradata Query Language\) apps are great for workloads that can run more complex operations than SQL but still be expressed in BTEQ script.

### Java Apps

Java apps are great for more custom use cases or when logic needs to exist outside of pure SQL or BTEQ. To create a Java app, you have to implement a class in Java with a particular interface, and you'll have access to a context with some APIs.
