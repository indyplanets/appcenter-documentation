## Dedication to Public Domain Agreement ("This Dedication")

Thank you for your interest in Teradata documentation. If you want to contribute to Teradata documentation, you must submit a Dedication to Public Domain Agreement. The process takes only a minute or two, and you need to submit "This Dedication" only once. If you already submitted one for another project, you do not need to submit it again.

Once you receive confirmation via email that your signed agreement has been received, submit your documentation suggestions for our review. Thank you.

To review and submit the agreement, see: <a href="https://www.hellosign.com/s/fb761368">Dedication to Public Domain Agreement</a>
