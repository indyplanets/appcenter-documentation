Only Root users and Admins will see **Manage Users** in the navigation panel.

## How Users are Added

When users who are part of an LDAP and Active Directory (configured by the Root user) first log in, they are automatically added to the list of users. 

From the **Manage Users** view, you can perform the following tasks:

- View a list of all users
- Filter the list of users by administrative status
- Search for users
- Sort the list of users in descending or ascending order
- Promote a Non-Admin user to an Admin
- Demote an Admin user to a Non-Admin

**Note**: You can combine view and search options.

## Viewing the List of All Users

1. Log into AppCenter as a root user. AppCenter displays all users.

## Filtering Users by Administrative Status

1. Under **Users**, do any of the following:
 * To filter by Admins, click ![admin users button](/user-guide/images/admin-users.png).
 * To filter by non-administrative users, click ![non-admin users button](/user-guide/images/non-admin-users.png).
 * To clear the filter and view all users, click click ![clear search button](/user-guide/images/clear-search.png).

## Searching for Users

1. In the ![search users box](/user-guide/images/search.png) box, start typing any part of the user's name or email address. Listener filters the list of sources as you type.
2. To clear this search and view all users, click ![clear search button](/user-guide/images/clear-search.png).

**Tip**:  To hide the search box, click ![hide search button](/user-guide/images/hide-search.png)

## Sorting Users in Descending or Ascending Order

By default, AppCenter sorts the list of users in ascending order.

1. In the **User** header, do one of the following:
 * To sort by decending order (Z-A), click ![up arrow button](/user-guide/images/up-arrow.png).
 * To restore ascending order (A-Z), click ![down arrow button](/user-guide/images/down-arrow.png).
