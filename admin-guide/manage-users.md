Only Root users and Admins will see **Manage Users** in the navigation panel.

## How Users are Added

When users who are part of an LDAP and Active Directory (configured by the Root user) first log in, they are automatically added to the list of users. 

From the **Manage Users** view, you can perform the following tasks:

- View a list of all users
- Filter the list of users by administrative status
- Search for users
- Sort the list of users in descending or ascending order
- Promote users to and from Admin status

**Note**: You can combine view and search options.

## Viewing the List of All Users

When you log into AppCenter as a Root user, AppCenter displays all users by default.

## Filtering Users by Administrative Status

1. Under **Users**, do any of the following:
 * To filter by Admins, click ![admin users button](/user-guide/images/admin-users.png).
 * To filter by non-Admin users, click ![non-admin users button](/user-guide/images/non-admin-users.png).
 * To clear the filter and view all users, click ![clear search button](/user-guide/images/clear-search.png).

## Searching for Users

1. In the ![search users box](/user-guide/images/search.png) box, start typing any part of the user's name or email address. AppCenter filters the list of users as you type.
2. To clear this search filter and view all users, click ![clear search button](/user-guide/images/clear-search.png).

**Tip**:  To hide the search filter box, click ![hide search filter](/user-guide/images/hide-search-filter.png).

## Sorting Users in Descending or Ascending Order

By default, AppCenter sorts the list of users in ascending order.

1. In the **User** header, do one of the following:
 * To sort by decending order (Z-A), click ![up arrow button](/user-guide/images/up-arrow.png).
 * To restore ascending order (A-Z), click ![down arrow button](/user-guide/images/down-arrow.png).

## Promoting and Demoting users

1. In the card for the user you to promote or demote, do one of the following:
 * To promote a non-Admin to an Admin, click ![slider off button](/user-guide/images/slider-off.png).
 * To demote an Admin to a non-Admin, click ![slider on buton](/user-guide/images/slider-on.png).
